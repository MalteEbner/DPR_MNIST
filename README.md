# DPR_MNIST
DPR-MNIST challenge

This challenge was part of the course in 'Detection and Pattern Recognition' at the University of Stuttgart.
The task was to develop a classifier in Matlab to reach maximum accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

The convolutional neural network implemented reached 99.56% accuracy and used data augmentation.
